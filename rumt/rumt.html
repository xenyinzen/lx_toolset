<h1>Running Unix Memory Test</h1>

<h2>What is RUMT?</h2>

<p>
The goal of RUMT is to check the memory of a computer over a long period of
time and almost-real load conditions without having to interrupt the
services.
</p>

<p>
RUMT exploits the possibility of some Unix kernels to selectivly disable
some memory areas while still accessing them through the
<code>/dev/mem</code> device. The principle of RUMT is to write
pseudo-random data in these disabled memory areas, and later check them.
This principle and the original code for the deterministic pseudo-random
generator are from
<a href="http://www.eleves.ens.fr:8080/home/madore/">David Madore</a>.
</p>

<p>
This distribution contains another variant on the same theme: URUMT
allocates a large chunk of memory, locks it in memory using the
<code>mlock</code>(2) system call, and scans <code>/dev/mem</code> to find
where in physical memory the allocated area is. Then it continuously runs
the same tests in that memory.
</p>

<p>
URUMT can not be used to test a particular area of memory: the kernel will
give it whatever physical memory it feels like. But URUMT can be restarted
now and then, hopefully getting different physical memory each time. This is
perfect if you suspect you have bad bits, but do not know at all where they
are. Once you have sighted the bad bits, you can use a plain RUMT to test
more extensively the neighborhood.
</p>

<h2>How to use RUMT?</h2>

<h3><code>rumt_trymem</code></h3>

<p>
The core of RUMT is <code>rumt_trymem</code>, which accepts the following
options:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-d <var>device</var></code>: use <var>device</var> instead of
  <code>/dev/mem</code>.</li>
<li><code>-i <var>input seed</var></code>: check the memory areas according to
  <var>input seed</var>.</li>
<li><code>-o <var>output seed</var></code>: prepare the memory areas according
  to <var>output seed</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The remaining arguments are memory areas, with one of the syntax
<code>start+length</code> or <code>start-end</code> (where end is excluded).
Values can be suffixed with <code>k</code>, <code>M</code> or <code>p</code>
for kilobytes, megabytes or pages (usually 4kB, cf. <code>getconf
  PAGE_SIZE</code>). All values must be multiples of the page size.
</p>

<p>
The normal way to use RUMT is to call <code>rumt_trymem -o
<var>some_seed</var></code> on the disabled memory areas, wait some time and
then call <code>rumt_trymem -i</code> with the same seed on the same memory
areas. If nothing has changed, <code>rumt_trymem</code> will be silent. If
something has changed, the detected bad bits will be printed as
<code>0xAAAAAAAAAAAA.b±</code> with <code>AAAAAAAAAAAA</code> the address,
<code>b</code> the bit, and <code>±</code> the direction (<code>+</code> for
a bit that should be 0 and is 1, <code>-</code> else).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Beware!</strong> Calling <code>rumt_trymem -o</code> on memory areas
used by the system will likely cause crashes or data loss. Triple check your
arguments.
</p>

<h3><code>rumt_daemon</code></h3>

<p>
<code>rumt_daemon</code> is a shell script that calls
<code>rumt_trymem</code>, keeps track of the seed, and keeps a nice table of
detected bad bits. It can be configured using the <code>rumt.conf</code>
auxiliary script. See the comments in this script for options.
</p>

<h3><code>urumt</code></h3>

<p>
The standar way to run <code>urumt</code> is <code>urumt -p
  <var>num_pages</var></code>, where <var>num_pages</var> is the number of
pages to allocate and test. A typical value may be on eighth or one quarter
of your total physical memory. <code>urumt</code> will print some diagnosis
and start testing. It records its results in a file called
<code>urumt_stats</code> whose size is eight bytes per page of physical
memory (not tested memory). If bad bits are found, a message will also be
printed.
</p>

<p>
<code>urumt</code> accepts the followihg options:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-s <var>stats_file</var></code>: selects the file where statistics
  are stored.</li>
<li><code>-m <var>mem_device</var></code>: selects an alternate path for a
  <code>/dev/mem</code>-like device.</li>
<li><code>-d <var>delay</var></code>: selects the time (in microseconds)
  between series of tests.</li>
<li><code>-D <var>delay_modulus</var></code>: selects the number of pages
  to test between each sleep. Thus, the total time to test all page will be
  approximatively
  <var>num_pages</var>×<var>delay</var>/<var>delay_modulus</var> (in
  microseconds). The default value for <var>delay</var> is 900 (which will
  probably be rounded up to one time slice) and 1 for
  <var>delay_modulus</var>.</li>
<li><code>-b <var>max_bad_bits</var></code>: if <code>urumt</code> finds
  more than <var>max_bad_bits</var> in one page at once, it will print a
  message and exit. The reason for that is that memory is normally not
  <em>that</em> bad, but the internal data structures can themselves land on
  bad bits and get corrupted; if that happen, you do not want your
  statistics ruined.</li>
<li><code>-S</code>: diverts all messages to syslog; the facility is
  local0.</li>
<li><code>-P</code>: <code>urumt</code> will not run any test, but print its
  statistics file; the first column is the page number (in hexadecimal), the
  second column is the total number of times that page has been tested, the
  third column is the total number of errors found in that page.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It should be ok to run two <code>urumt</code> at the same time on the same
statistics file, since they will get distinct pages. If you restart
<code>urumt</code> to change the memory area being tested, it is probably a
good idea to start the new one before killing the first one, since it would
guarantee a totally new area (of course, if you're trying to check half your
memory at once, it will probably fail).
</p>

<h3><code>rumt_fusion</code></h3>

<p>
This is a perl script used by <code>rumt_daemon</code> to beautify the list
of bad bits.
</p>

<h3><code>highmem.o</code></h3>

<p>
On Linux, for those who have more than 960MB of memory and so enabled the
<code>CONFIG_HIGHMEM</code> option, <code>/dev/mem</code> gives access to
only the first 768MB. This kernel module creates
<code>/dev/misc/highmem</code> which does not have this limit.
</p>

<p>
Beware. This code has been tested on my box without crashing it. It has also
been posted on LKML, but got no answer. I do not know if it is compatible
with the <code>CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G</code> option. Use at your own risks.
</p>

<p>
Beware (bis). This code has not been ported nor tested with 2.6 kernels.
</p>

<h3><code>print_holes_linux</code></h3>

<p>
This perl script will parse the boot messages of a Linux kernel to guess its
command lines options and disabled memory areas. It prints one line with the
<code>mem=</code> arguments to the kernel, and one line with the disabled
areas in a format suitable for <code>rumt_trymem</code>.
</p>

<p>
You should double-check the former with your Grub/LILO/whatever
configuration <em>and</em> your <code>/proc/cmdline</code> before using the
later.
</p>

<h2>What is the status of RUMT?</h2>

<p>
RUMT works for me at home with a 2.4.20 Linux kernel;
<code>rumt_trymem</code> and the shell scripts should be quite portable.
There is no installation procedure: is started from its compilation
directory; anyway, RUMT is not a program that one wants to use now and then.
</p>

<p>
I do not intend to make RUMT a well-packaged program: I will program it
until I find my bad memory bits, and that's all. I give it to the comunity
as is, and whoever wants to enhance it is welcome.
